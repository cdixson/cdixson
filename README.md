:wave: Hi, I’m @cdixson, Chris. You're viewing my personal GitHub page. My professional page is [here](https://github.com/cdixson1) (my repos are private, it is the government after all).

:business_suit_levitating: I’m a Programmer and Web Developer, contractor supporting NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Data and Information Systems Branch,  U.S. Department of Commerce. If you want more info, my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdixson/) page goes into all the boring details.

:toolbox: In my spare time I participate in amateur radio ([K1PRD](https://www.qrz.com/db/K1PRD)), and spend time woodworking.
