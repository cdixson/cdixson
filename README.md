:wave: Hi, I’m @cdixson, Chris. You're viewing my personal GitHub page. My professional page is [here](https://github.com/cdixson1) (my repos are private, it is the government after all).

:business_suit_levitating: I’m a Programmer and Web Developer, contractor supporting NOAA Fisheries in the Data and Information Systems Branch which is under the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Fishery Monitoring and Research Division. If you want more info about my background, checkout my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdixson/) page.

:toolbox: In my spare time I participate in amateur radio ([K1PRD](https://www.qrz.com/db/K1PRD)), and spend time woodworking.
